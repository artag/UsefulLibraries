<h1>How I do my computing</h1>

<div class="comp">

    <h2>My computer</h2>
    <p>
        I use a Thinkpad T400s computer, which has a free
        initialization program (libreboot) and a free operating system
        (Trisquel GNU/Linux). It was not sold that way by Lenovo,
        however; small businesses buy them used, recondition them, and
        install the free software.  This is one of the
        computers <a href="https://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/systems">
        endorsed by the FSF</a>.

    <h2>GNU/Linux distro</h2>
    <p>
        I do not have a preferred GNU/Linux distro.  I recommend all the
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/distros">ethical distros</a> &mdash;
        namely, those that are 100% free software.

    <p>
        This is not an ethical issue, just my own personal preference.  On
        the ethical level, I think it is important for free software to
        provide convenient free graphical user interface software, which is
        why the GNU Project launched three projects to develop that.  The
        third, <a href="http://gnome.org/">GNOME</a>, was successful, so we
        never needed a fourth one.

    <h2>How this site is maintained</h2>
    <p>
        This site is maintained in a very simple way.  I edit the pages such
        as this one manually as HTML.  I only know simple HTML; others who
        know more wrote the parts at the top and bottom of pages, and the
        more complex formatting on the home page.  Volunteer helpers install
        the political notes every day after receiving the text from me by
        email.  A cron job "rolls over" the political notes page every two
        months.  The photo galleries are generated with <a
            href="http://www.netpurgatory.com/downloads.html#thumbnail">this
        perl script</a>.  The search feature on the site is done with
        <a href="/site-search/StallmanOrgSearch.tar.gz">this code</a>.

    <p>
        An <a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/RUE/">
        explanation of the concept of designing</a> a "user experience"
        which also shows why I find it loathsome.
        This is why I want stallman.org to remain simple: not a "user
        experience" but rather a place where I present certain information,
        views and action opportunities to you.


    <h2>How I use the Internet</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                I am careful in how I connect to the internet.
                <br /><br />
                Specifically, I refuse to connect through portals that would
                require me to identify myself, or to run any nontrivial
                <a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">nonfree
                    Javascript code</a>.  I use <a href="https://gnu.org/software/librejs/"> to prevent nonfree Javascript code from running.</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                I avoid
                paying with <a href="/rms-lifestyle.html#cards">
                credit cards</a> generally.  For freedom's sake, insist on
                paying cash.  When a business pressures you to pay in
                an identified way, it's your chance to defend freedom by
                saying, "If you won't take my cash, no sale!"
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                I would not mind paying for a copy of <a href="/ebooks.pdf">an
                e-book</a> or <a href="/internet-music.html">music recording</a>
                on the Internet if I could do so anonymously, and it treated me
                justly in other ways (no DRM or EULA).  But that option almost
                never exists. I keep looking for ways to make it exist.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Social media</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a name="social-networking">I do not use any social networking
                    sites</a> because that way of working is inconvenient for me.
                That doesn't mean I think they are all unethical.  Some are,
                some are not. Social networking sites raise their own set of
                ethical issues, completely different from the ethical issues of
                distributing software (<a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">
                free vs proprietary</a>), and there are big differences between
                them.

            <p>
                <a name="twitter">I have a Twitter account</a> called
                rmspostcomments, which I use to log in on other sites to post
                comments on articles. I never post on Twitter.  Someone made an
                account stallman_feed which I'm told posts something about my
                political notes. Any other Twitter account that claims to be
                mine is an impostor.

            <p>
                The rms account on gnusocial.no repeats the political notes from
                this site, but I do not post on it directly.  That site runs
                <a href="http://gnu.org/software/social">GNU Social</a>.

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                I have <a name="facebook">never had a Facebook account</a>, or a
                Google+ account.  Some impostor created a Facebook account using
                my name.  The page is not mine.  The Google+ account using my
                name is also not mine.

            <p id="realname">
                I reject Facebook because it requires each used (i.e., person
                used by Facebook) to have just one account, which means that all
                the person's activities are grouped together.  It also insists
                on knowing the person's usual name, and it is starting to demand
                a series of different photos.

            <p>
                Of course, <a href="/facebook.html">Facebook is bad for
                many other reasons as well.</a>

            <p>
                Google+ formerly required knowing the user's real name, but
                no longer.  However, it does require identification in the form
                of a phone number. Meanwhile, Google+ has another unacceptable
                injustice: it requires
                <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">
                    running nonfree Javascript code</a> to post a message.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Programming languages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a name="lisp">The most powerful programming language is Lisp.</a>
                If you don't know Lisp (or its variant, Scheme), you don't know
                what it means for a programming language to be powerful and
                elegant. Once you learn Lisp, you will see what is lacking in
                most other languages.

            <p>
                Lisp is no harder to understand than other languages.  So if you
                have never learned to program, and you want to start, start with
                Lisp.  If you learn to edit with Emacs, you can learn Lisp by
                writing editing commands for Emacs.  You can use the
                Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp to learn with: it is <a
                    href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-doc.html">free as in
                freedom</a>, and you can <a
                    href="http://shop.fsf.org/category/books">order printed copies</a>
                from the FSF.

            <p>
                You can learn Scheme (and a lot of deep ideas about programming)
                from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by
                Abelson and Sussman.  That book is now free/libre although the
                printed copies do not say so.
                <br /><br />
                Please <a href="/amazon.html">don't buy books (or anything)
                from Amazon!</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to learn programming</h2>
    <a name="learnprogramming"></a>
    <p>
        First, read a textbook about programming in some language, then
        manuals for several programming languages <a href="#lisp">including
        Lisp</a>. If this makes natural intuitive sense to you, that
        indicates your mind is well-adapted towards programming.

    <p>
        Please use your programming capability only for good, not for evil.
        Don't develop nonfree software, or <a
            href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html">
        service as a software substitute</a>.  Design systems not to collect
        personal information, and to allow anonymous use.

    <h2>Streaming medias and DRM issues</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a name="streaming">Streaming</a> media dis-services such as
                Netflix and Spotify require nonfree client programs that impose
                digital restrictions mechanisms (<a
                    href="http://DefectiveByDesign.org/">DRM</a>) intended to stop
                the user from saving a copy of the data being streamed through
                her own computer.  You should never use DRM that you can't break,
                so you should not use these dis-services unless you can break
                their DRM.

            <p>
                An additional injustice of these and other streaming client
                programs is that they impose unjust contracts (EULAs) which
                restrict the user more strictly than copyright law itself.  I do
                not agree to EULAs, period, and I urge you to join me in
                rejecting them.

            <p>
                These streaming dis-services are malicious technology designed
                to make people antisocial.  (If you don't have a copy, you can't
                share copies.)  Rejecting them is of the highest ethical
                priority.

            <p>
                A friend once asked me to watch a video with her that she was
                going to display on her computer using Netflix.  I declined,
                saying that Netflix was such a threat to freedom that I could
                not treat it as anything but an enemy.

            <p>
                Out, out, damned Spotify!  Flick off, Netflix!

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Every product with <a href="http://DefectiveByDesign.org">Digital
                Restrictions Management</a> (DRM) is an attack on your freedom.

            <p>
                Therefore, one should not buy or tolerate any product with DRM
                handcuffs unless one personally possesses the means to break the
                handcuffs.  For instance, don't use encrypted DVDs unless you
                have DeCSS or another comparable free program.  And never use
                a Bluray disk unless you find a way to break its handcuffs.
                Don't use the <a href="/ebooks.pdf"> Amazon Swindle</a>
                or other e-book readers that trample readers' freedoms.
                Don't use music or video streaming "services" that impose DRM.
                (If they require a nonfree client program, it is probably for
                DRM or some sort of surveillance of users.)
